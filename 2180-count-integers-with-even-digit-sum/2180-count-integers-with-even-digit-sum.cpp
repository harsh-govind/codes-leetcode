/*
We calculate the sum, and then apply formula (we just need to check if the sum is even or odd) to calculate the final answer.
I got the idea while checking the given examples in the description. Just try to check what will be the ouptut for 10, 20, 30, 40 etc:
10 = 2, 4, 6, 8 (4)
20 = 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20 (10)
30 = 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28. (14)
